    "A logarithm is the inverse function to exponentitation i.e.  logb(x) is equal to the number that 'b' must be raised to to get x. [3] The Mathematician John Napier is widely acredited for his contribution to the devleopment of logarithms in 1614 [4]. Napiers work was driven by the need to reduce the amount of effort that went into decoding astronomical calculations. Though the application of logarithms for large calculations proved ground breaking in its field, it quickly became appearent that the implications of logarithms had a farther reach than imagined, in science, in engineering, and in acuracry [4].\n",
