    "Gender Bias is the tendency to assign specific characteristics to a gender without supporting evidence. e.g. In a previous role a company made the male changing rooms twice the size of the female changing rooms. As it happened they hired more females than males however there was not enough room in the changing rooms to support the additional female staff. There was an assumption made that becuase this was an drug-engineer manufacturing site there would be more males than females. This cost the company money in redoing the female changing rooms to ensure that both changing rooms were equal in capacity[2]"
